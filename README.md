Final Project - Virtual Chat System

The aim of this project is to create a way of allowing TAs in large CS classes to conduct Virtual Office Hours with the students in the class.
This is especially important given that the enrollment into CS classes has exceeded the threshold for which TAs can help all students in the
class during office hours results in clogged and backlogged office hours queues. This applications tries to allieviate some of the issues caused 
by this.
